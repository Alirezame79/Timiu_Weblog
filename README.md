# Challenges

Experts know that in a real app, all the parts are challeges. But of course I have sth to tell you in this section.

## 1. Page Routing:

Honestlly, I have better feeling for `Page Routing` than `App Routing`. It was an amazing experience.

I also use `dynamic routing` for each article like: `post/[id]`.

## 2. Typescript:

It wasn't the first time, I made an app with typescript and I always enjoy that. It reminds me the time I wrote `Java` codes.

working with `Types` always a pleasure.

## 3. Bootstrap:

In many aspects, `Bootstrap` is an amazing tool but I still prefer `Tailwind` because I can write the plain `css` code by my hands, and I have the total control on what I'm coding.

But also It helps me a lot.

## 4. SCSS/SASS

I used it before and it just help us in some few cases to reduce the size of codes.

I enjoy using that.

## 5. Miltulevel Signing up

It was a good time to code this part. It's just handling some state and forms. nothing more...

## 6. Drag and Drop elements

I try to use famouse libraries but finnaly I decide to write that by my own. And I can say that it was awesome. controling `index` and replacing elements. all of them were perfect.

prefer you take a look at them. the path is `post/edit/[id]`.
